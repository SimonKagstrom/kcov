Building Kcov
=============

You need development headers and libraries for libstdc++, curl, elfutils
and (optional) binutils and libiberty to build kcov. Note that elfutils is
found in multiple variants, and at least in RH/Centos/Fedora you'll need
elfutils-devel and *not* elfutils-libelf-devel.

Create an empty build dir and do the following steps:

    cmake [options] <path/to/kcov/source/dir>
    make
    make install

Useful options include -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path> (installation prefix),
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<type> and -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=<CFLAGS>.

Basic example:

    cd /path/to/kcov/source/dir
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install

More advanced example:

    cd /path/to/kcov/source/dir
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake \
      -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS:STRING="-O3 -march=i686" \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr \
      ..
    make -j2 || exit 1
    make install DESTDIR=/tmp/kcov-build || exit 1

For further information refer to cmake documentation:
    http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake-2-8-docs.html.


Troubleshooting
===============

If you have elfutils installed, but cmake fails to find it, specify elfutils
install prefix explicitly to cmake. Here is an example:

    cd kcov
    CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/elfutils-dir/ \
    cmake .
    make
    make install
