Kcov (17):
	* Issue #19: Fix bug where kcov would let children which called
	  setpgid live even after terminating kcov itself (Oliver)

	* Issue #16: Output: Implement a merged mode, which shows a
	  combination of all covered programs under the [merged] link

	* Fix an HTML output bug introduced in kcov 14 where the summary
	  counts in the index page would be wrong.

	* Issue #15: Fix a crash when source lines are > ~2000 characters long

	* Issue #17: Fix parsing of multiple include/exclude patterns
	  (Jamie Kirkpatrick)

	* Split usage in common/uncommon options

	* Improve unit tests and robot framework tests

	* Various work on the kernel-engine and general refactoring

	-- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>,

Kcov (16):
	* kernel-engine: Implement an engine to handle kernel code coverage
	  collection (not finished)

	* kprobe-coverage: Refactor the kernel module so that it basically
	  works now

	* Code refactoring and more C++11-izing

	* Python: Filter out some false negatives (i.e., non-executable
	  lines marked as red)

	* Python: Report absolute paths so that output filtering works

	* Python: Catch exceptions in the python helper to avoid EOF etc
	  being propagated upwards (and coverage collection to fail)

	* Python: Fix a case where the engine would simply hang on waiting
	  for more data

	-- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Fri Mar 21 16:38:28 CET 2014


Kcov (15):
	* Workaround a shared-library issue where kcov would sometimes hang on
	  the malloc. The workaround uses a static memory buffer instead.

	* Implemented support for collecting Python code coverage! Usage is the
	  same as for compiled code.

	* Code-restructuring to allow multiple "engines", which makes it possible
	  to add the python support above.

	* More C++11-izing of the code

	-- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Sun Mar  2 10:50:00 CET 2014


Kcov (14):
	* Add two options, --collect-only and --report-only to only collect
	  coverage and produce Cobertura/HTML output respectively. Can be
	  used for example on embedded systems where the source code isn't
	  available.

	* PowerPC support has been added (thanks to Aleksandr Vilchinskii and
	  Konstantin Polivtsev for testing this)

	-- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Wed Feb  5 19:42:03 CET 2014


Kcov (13):
	* Don't hang the kcov main process if a breakpoint comes in
	  before the solib handler constructor has executed (depends on
	  the construction order)

	* Correct bug with realloc in solib handling (malloc all
	  data once only)

	-- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Sun Dec  8 19:34:37 CET 2013

Kcov (12):
	* Fix lockup bug in the solib code path (where processes with
	  many solibs would hang at startup)

	* Correct a crash in the reporter

	* Add test case for signals

	* Report from main thread to avoid threading issues
	
	* Fairly major refactoring of ptrace code to avoid an issue
	  where two PTRACE_CONTINUE calls could be done without
	  waitpid() in between. This would cause crashes in the
	  traced program.

	* Add support for looking for debug info in separate files
	  via build-id (Alexander Larsson)

	* Add --exit-first-process option to fork kcov when covering
	  daemons (otherwise kcov will wait for all children to finish)

	* Add --skip-solibs option to disable processing of shared
	  libraries, which also works around a bug which sometimes
	  triggers 

	* Add --replace-source-path option for cases where the sources
	  have been moved (James Warner)

	* Fix linking (Igor Murzov) 

	* Some build fixes to make it build with clang++

	* Fix various warnings

	* Add experimental profiler based on kcov

	* Add sorting by reverse-percent (high -> low, -u option)

	* Cache non-existing files to avoid doing lstat calls all the
	  time (slight performance improvement)

	* closedir() was not called from the html-writer, which creates
	  a resource leak (Karl Vogel)

	-- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Sat Oct 19 11:06:42 CEST 2013
	

Kcov (11):
	* Fix handling of common paths in HTML writer

	* Fix bug in shared library handling where repeated exec()s would
	  cause strange hangs. Fixed by unsetting the KCOV_SOLIB_PATH environment
	  variable after the first executable has been started.
	  Add test-popen test case to check for this.

	* Expand ~'s in the --include-path and --exclude-path options

	* Unbreak accumulating data from multiple runs again (introduced
	  sometime during refactoring), and add test case for this

	-- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Sat Aug 18 08:45:03 CEST 2012

Kcov (10):
	* Fix bug where multiple files with the same name would only be shown
	  once in the HTML output.

	* Fix icache conflict bug (present while instrumenting shared libraries)
	  on multi-CPU systems by forcing all traced processes to one CPU

	* Re-enable the --pid=PID argument to trace a running process again

	* Fix race condition in the reporter

	* Only set breakpoints in executable sections. This avoids problems where
	  the DWARF line information points to non-code sections (which can happen)

	* Fix coverage reporting of orphaned children (where the parent does not
	  wait(2) for the child

	* Use std::unordered_map for breakpoints (improves performance somewhat)

	* Improve unit tests

	* Add robot-framework testsuite that can be run from a Jenkins server

	-- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Mon Jul 23 13:28:43 CEST 2012
	
Kcov (9):
	* Completely refactor the source code (yes, everything!), and add
	  unit tests to verify kcov itself. The code is now in C++.
	  
	* Implement transparent coverage instrumentation for shared libraries
	  (done automatically)
	  
	* Implement a Cobertura-compatible XML backend. This allows integrating
	  kcov coverage information in Jenkins.
	  
	* Improve performance a lot by filtering out files already at the
	  instrumentation step (and not only during HTML generation). This
	  means that --include-pattern/--include-path can improve kcov performance
	  by quite a bit.

	-- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Fri Jun 15 17:39:17 CEST 2012

Kcov (8):
	* Import the man-page from Debian and update it.

	* Simplify parts of the ptrace code

	* Correct the sorting of files-by-percentage when the difference
	  is less than 0.5% (thanks Martin!).

	* Correct the percentage-bar color according to the configured
	  limits in the report.

	-- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Sun Dec  4 14:13:47 CET 2011

Kcov (7):
	* Weed out common parts of source paths from the report, display
	  the full path as the HTML title= tag

	* Fix crash bug in argument passing

	* Handle hit count a bit better

	-- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, 2011-07-10

Kcov (6):
	* Correct hit count. The hit count is no longer over the number of
	  possible hits

	* Better error reporting when stripped or otherwise broken binaries
	  are passed to kcov

	* Handle files with relative directory paths (lookup the absolute
	  path via DWARF source files). Otherwise, some files are not reported
	  in the output.

	* Add test program to detect regressions

	* Detect stripped binaries and report that you'll need to build
	  with -g

	* Correct --include/exclude-path behavior. The previous version
	  will match PATH*/* instead of just PATH/* (Igor Murzov)
	  
	* Various small fixes 

	-- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Sat Apr 16 08:28:27 CEST 2011

Kcov (5):
	* Switch from libdwarf to libdw (from elfutils) for building
	  kcov. libdw is a bit more logical than libdwarf.
	  
	* Implement actual path matching (Igor Murzov)

	* Rename path-matching to pattern matching (which is what it does)
	  and set it up using long options.

	* Parse options with getopt

	* Don't escape all multibyte characters in the report. That will
	  break display of UTF-8 etc (Igor Murzov)

	* Improve cmake packaging support (Igor Murzov)

	-- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Sat Feb 12 15:25:57 CET 2011

Kcov (4):
	* Build system is now based on cmake (Igor Murzov)

	* Add MIPS32, ARM and PowerPC architecture support. This is untested though
	  and might very well not work at all. 
	  
	* Add -t option to set the title of the program to test (otherwise it
	  will be the filename) 

	* Refactored the architecture support to allow running i386 programs
	  on x86_64 machines, and easier add other architectures

	* Make it possible to collect coverage from multiple programs in a
	  single directory, useful for example when running a test suite

	* Add coverage color to the header as well

	* Misc refactoring  

	-- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Tue Dec  7 18:20:28 CET 2010

Kcov (3):
	* Various bug fixes

	* Add ability to trace running processes by PID

	* Fix copyright headers

	-- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Sat Nov 13 08:13:03 CET 2010

Kcov (2):
	* Misc fixes

	* Add ability to specify low/high limits

	* Add state saving between runs. Re-starting the same program
	  will then add to existing coverage instead of starting from
	  scratch.

	* Link to web page in the report

	* Add option to sort by percentage or file name

	-- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Sun Oct 24 09:15:39 CEST 2010

Kcov (1):
	* Initial release

	-- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>
