.SH NAME
kcov \- Code coverage analysis using DWARF debugging information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kcov
.RI [ options ] " outdir executable [ args for executable ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This manual page documents briefly the \fBkcov\fP command. \fBkcov\fP is a
code coverage tester based on bcov by Thomas Neumann. It allows collecting
code coverage information from executables without special command-line
arguments, and continuously produces output from long-running applications.
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invoke bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-p\fP, \fB\-\-pid\fP=\fIPID\fP
Trace PID instead of executing executable, executable is optional in this case.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP, \fB\-\-sort\-type\fP=\fItype\fP
How to sort files: f[ilename] (default), p[ercent].
.TP
\fB\-l\fP, \fB\-\-limits\fP=\fIlow,high\fP
Setup limits for low/high coverage (default: 16,50).
.TP
\fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-title\fP=\fItitle\fP
Set the web page title to title.
.TP
\fB\-\-path\-strip\-level\fP=\fIN\fP
Number of path levels to show for common paths (default: 2).
.TP
\fB\-\-include\-path\fP=\fIP1\fP[\fI,P2\fP...]
Comma-separated list of paths to include in the report.
.TP
\fB\-\-exclude\-path\fP=\fIP1\fP[\fI,P2\fP...]
Comma-separated list of paths to exclude from the report.
.TP
\fB\-\-include\-pattern\fP=\fIP1\fP[\fI,P2\fP...]
Comma-separated list of patterns to include in the report.
.TP
\fB\-\-exclude\-pattern\fP=\fIP1\fP[\fI,P2\fP...]
Comma-separated list of patterns to exclude from the report.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Check coverage for ./frodo and generate HTML output in /tmp/kcov
.PP
.RS
kcov /tmp/kcov ./frodo
.RE
.PP
Check coverage for ./frodo but only include source files names with the string src/frodo
.PP
.RS
kcov \-\-include\-pattern=src/frodo /tmp/kcov ./frodo
.RE
.SH HTML OUTPUT
.PP
The HTML output shows executed and non-executed lines of the source code. Some lines can map to multiple instrumentation points, for example for inlined functions (where every inlining of them will generate a separate instrumentation point). This is shown in the left column as 1/3 for example, which means that one of the three instrumentation points has been executed.
